<p>Hi, my name is Marina Potrero, and I am a senior at Arizona College studying to get my Ecology major and Business minor. I was born 
and raised in Phoenix and have three sisters. I live in an off-campus apartment with my boyfriend and a pet field mouse called Mr. Souris, 
and I work at the campus greenhouse and garden. All of the produce at the school’s organic cafe comes from the greenhouse and garden.</p>
<p>My biggest pet peeve is wastefulness, and I’d like my career to revolve around eliminating food waste. I was offered a state 
grant to start a program called Students Reducing Food Waste. The grant is given to students pursuing environmental causes, and 
SRFN is an initiative to reduce—and hopefully eliminate—food waste altogether. It involves volunteers going to businesses and schools, 
collecting consumable food that would otherwise be thrown away, and giving it to homeless shelters. We also collect non-consumable food 
and use it to fertilize the campus greenhouse and garden. If restaurants have used vegetable oil, we take it, filter it, and use it to run machinery on campus.</p>
<p>My vision is for this process to become something that businesses and individuals do automatically—much like recycling. I would love it 
if every business, restaurant, institution, farm, and grocery store committed to sending all of the food they would otherwise throw away to
 shelters and orphanages. Food that is deemed non-consumable by human standards would be composted and used on community farms. Anyone inclined
 to learn to tend the land would be able to sell what they produce and keep the profits.  </p>
